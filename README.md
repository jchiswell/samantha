# Project Jarvis: Voice-Controlled AI Assistant on Raspberry Pi

This project aims to create a voice-controlled AI assistant on a Raspberry Pi using Gemini, Vosk, and Coqui TTS.

## Setup Instructions

These instructions outline the steps we've taken to set up the Raspberry Pi.

**1. Install Raspberry Pi OS**

* Download the latest Raspberry Pi OS image from the official website.
* Flash the image to an SD card using a tool like Balena Etcher.
* Boot the Raspberry Pi from the SD card.

**2. Connect to Wi-Fi**

* Use the `raspi-config` tool or the desktop environment to connect your Raspberry Pi to your Wi-Fi network.

**3. Enable SSH**

* Enable SSH access to your Raspberry Pi through `raspi-config` or the desktop environment.

**4. Update and upgrade packages**

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade
Use code with caution.

5. Install required packages

Bash
sudo apt-get install bluetooth bluez pulseaudio-module-bluetooth
Use code with caution.

6. Create a virtual environment

Bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
Use code with caution.

7. Install Python libraries

Bash
pip install vosk TTS sounddevice
Use code with caution.

8. Download and extract models

Vosk: Download a language model from Vosk download page and extract it to your project directory.
Coqui TTS: Download a voice model from the Coqui TTS model repository and extract it to your project directory.
9. Create and encrypt a configuration file for your API key

Create a file named config.ini and add your Gemini API key:
<!-- end list -->

Ini, TOML
[gemini]
api_key = your_actual_api_key_here
Use code with caution.

Encrypt the file using openssl:
<!-- end list -->

Bash
openssl aes-256-cbc -salt -in config.ini -out config.ini.enc
Use code with caution.

10. Create an api_key.py module to access the API key

Create a file named api_key.py (refer to previous responses for the code).
11. (Optional) Connect Bluetooth speaker

Follow the instructions in the previous response to connect a Bluetooth speaker to your Raspberry Pi.
Next Steps
Write the main Python script to interact with Gemini, using the get_api_key function from api_key.py.
Implement a wake word or push-to-talk mechanism.
Integrate with Home Assistant.
Explore additional features and improvements.
